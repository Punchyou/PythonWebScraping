#Your first task will be to download web pages.
# The requests package comes to the rescue.
# It aims to be an easy-to-use tool for doing all things HTTP in Python.

#The simple_get() function accepts a single url argument.
# It then makes a GET request to that URL.
# If nothing goes wrong, you end up with the raw HTML content for the page you requested.
# If there were any problems with your request (like the URL is bad, or the remote server is down), then your function returns None.
# You may have noticed the use of the closing() function in your definition of simple_get().
# The closing() function ensures that any network resources are freed when they go out of scope in that with block.
# Using closing() like that is good practice and helps to prevent fatal errors and network timeouts.

#Once you have raw HTML in front of you, you can start to select and extract.
# For this purpose, you will be using BeautifulSoup.
# The BeautifulSoup constructor parses raw HTML strings and produces an object that mirrors the HTML documentâ€™s structure.
# The object includes a slew of methods to select, view, and manipulate DOM nodes and text content.

#BeautifulSoup accepts multiple back-end parsers, but the standard back-end is 'html.parser',
# which you supply here as the second argument.

#The select() method on your html object lets you use CSS selectors to locate elements in the document.
# In the above case, html.select('p') returns a list of paragraph elements.
# Each p has HTML attributes that you can access like a dict. In the line if p['id'] == 'walrus', for example,
# you check if the id attribute is equal to the string 'walrus', which corresponds to <p id="walrus"> in the HTML.

#Use json.dumps to pretty print your data


"""Attempts to get the content at 'url' by making an HTTP GET request.

otherwise return None."""
"""Returns True if the response seems to be HTML, False otherwise."""
"""Downloads the page where expected data are found and returns a list of strings."""
""" Finds points, author names, comments and ranks from html."""
""" Makes a list of all the data that retrieved from the html."""
